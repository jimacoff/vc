  <p><%= @company.name %> will be pitching in <%= @company.team.name.titleize %> on <%= @company.pitch.when.to_date.to_s(:long) %>.</p>
  <% if @company.pitch.snapshot.present? %>
    <p>The snapshot can be found <a href="<%= @company.pitch.snapshot %>">here</a>.</p>
  <% else %>
    <p>
      I couldn't find a file named "<%= @company.name %> Snapshot" in Drive. Please ask one of the involved partners (<%= @company.users.map(&:name).join(', ') %>) to send out the snapshot.
    </p>
  <% end %>
  <p>
    <%= @company.team.name.titleize %> partners, please add your comments to the snapshot by <%= (@company.pitch.when.to_date - 1.day).to_s(:long) %>. Everyone else, please feel free to add comments!
  </p>
