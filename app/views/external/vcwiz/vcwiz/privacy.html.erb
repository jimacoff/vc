  <h1>DORM ROOM FUND PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
  <p>
    Dorm Room Fund Management, LLC (“Dorm Room Fund” and sometimes referred to as “we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of visitors to its websites (“you”, and sometimes referred to as “your”).  As a result, we have developed this website privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”).  This Privacy Policy applies only to the operation of websites that directly link to this policy when you click on the "Privacy Policy" or equivalent link (each, a “Website” and collectively, the “Websites”).
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect About You</h2>

  <div>
    We collect the following types of information about you:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Information That You Provide To Us. We collect information that you choose to provide to us in connection with a Website (including through any registration process). This may include information such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, zip code, user name, and password.

      <li>
        Information Collected Automatically.  Utilizing commonly used Internet technologies such as cookies and web beacons, we also may automatically collect information about your computer or mobile device and certain online activity when you access a Website.  For example, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and operating system, as well as information about which pages you visit and the page, if any, that referred you to our sites or that you visit after our sites.  There’s additional information about our use of cookies below.

      <li>
        Location Information. When you access a Website, we may collect information about your location separately from your address or other information that you provide to us explicitly.  For instance, we may use the GPS feature of your mobile device or your IP address to help determine your geographic location. If you prefer that we not know your geographic location, you will have the option to disable the function when you first access a Website in which we collect information about your location (or later, if your mobile device allows you to change the settings after initial download).

Any access that we may have to such information from any such account is in accordance with the privacy notice/policy and authorization procedures determined by the provider of that account.

      <li>
        Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website.  Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Website and otherwise use the Website through the Internet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain any of your personal information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other information to tell us who you are.  As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Website and may associate that information with your registration information, if you have registered with the Website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they may enable you to take advantage of certain features of the Website.
      </li>
      <li>
        This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link on the Website points may set cookies on your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        We or our third-party partners also may use technologies called web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or e-mails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or e-mail message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the web beacon was viewed. We and our partners use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Website and in conjunction with cookies.  You may disable our web beacons in e-mail messages by turning off images in your e-mail client.  Please see the instructions for your particular e-mail client for more information. Please also be aware that by turning off images you may not be able to enjoy all features of the Website.
