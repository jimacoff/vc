      Check out the <a href="<%= external_vcwiz_outreach_url %>">Conversations Tracker page</a> for more details.

    <p>
      We have an awesome new feature that I'm super excited to share with you.
      VCWiz is now able to map out your professional graph, and figure out the best "intro path" to any investor.
      Just enable the Inbox Scanner, and we'll figure out who each of your contacts can best intro you to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound great? Click <a href="<%= external_vcwiz_gmail_auth_url %>"><b>here</b></a> to enable the scanner!
      Don't worry, no human will ever read your emails, and VCWiz will never use your inbox for anything without your permission.
    </p>
