  Hey <%= @investor.first_name %>!
</p>

<p>
  Someone (hopefully you) just asked for a verification email from the VCWiz Investor Portal for <%= @investor.competitor.name %>.
  If this was you, click <b><a href="<%=  external_vcwiz_investors_token_url(token: @investor.token, email: @email) %>">here</a></b> to access the portal.
  If if wasn't, ignore this and have a great day!
</p>

<p>
  Cheers,<br>
  VCWiz
